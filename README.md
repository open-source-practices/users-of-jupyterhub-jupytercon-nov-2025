Presented at [JupyterCon 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/jupytercon/)

## Abstract
Join JupyterHub's project team and other users and administrators of JupyterHub for a half day workshop exploring their experiences, perspectives, and ideas for the future of the project. 
The session will forge closer links between JupyterHub's volunteer community and Hub administrators, while collectively identifying improvement opportunities and strengthening community-driven development. 

We'll kick off with lightning talks showcasing diverse JupyterHub implementations across education, research, and industry, sparking cross-domain knowledge sharing. 
We'll then reflect on different aspects of the project and community in focused breakout sessions before coming back together to discuss as a group. Finally, we'll explore practical opportunities for direct contribution to the project. 

This session is aimed at those who have deployed or used JupyterHub at least once before, and would like to share their experiences and learn from others. 
The core team will also be looking for opportunities to more publicly celebrate their contributors to JupyterHub, both online, and with physical tokens of appreciation.
